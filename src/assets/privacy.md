# Privacy Policy for FilmSphere

**Last Updated: March 06, 2025**

Welcome to **FilmSphere**, a fun, coin-based movie reservation system designed as a learning project by Anupam, Rachit, and Keshav. At FilmSphere, we value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how we handle your information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it. By using FilmSphere, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 1. About FilmSphere

FilmSphere is an open-source, educational project inspired by roadmap.sh, allowing users to browse movies, book virtual show tickets using a coin-based system, and interact with features like an interactive seating layout and booking history. This Privacy Policy applies to your use of FilmSphere and its associated services.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

As an educational project, FilmSphere collects minimal data to enable its features. We may collect the following:

### 2.1 Information You Provide

- **Profile Information**: If you create a profile, we may collect basic details like a username, email address (optional), or other identifiers you choose to provide.
- **Booking Data**: Details of your virtual ticket bookings, such as movie selections, seat choices, and timestamps, stored locally or in your profile for the booking history feature.
- **Contributions**: If you contribute to FilmSphere via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/filmsphere/filmsphere), we may collect your GitHub username or other information you submit with your contributions.

### 2.2 Automatically Collected Information

- **Usage Data**: Basic analytics about how you interact with FilmSphere (e.g., pages visited, features used), collected for educational insights into user behavior and system performance.
- **Device Information**: General data like device type, browser version, and operating system to ensure responsive design compatibility.
- **Virtual Coins**: Records of virtual coin usage within FilmSphere, which have no real-world value and are tied to your session or profile.

### 2.3 Cookies and Similar Technologies

- FilmSphere may use cookies or local storage to maintain your session (e.g., dark/light mode preference, virtual coin balance). These are minimal and functional, not used for tracking or advertising.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- **Provide Features**: Enable browsing, seat selection, virtual coin bookings, and profile management.
- **Improve FilmSphere**: Analyze usage patterns to enhance the project’s functionality and user experience as part of our learning goals.
- **Support Contributions**: Process and display your contributions if you participate via GitHub.
- **Ensure Functionality**: Maintain a seamless experience across devices with responsive design.

We do **not** use your information for commercial purposes, advertising, or profit.

---

## 4. How We Share Your Information

FilmSphere is an educational project, and we do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for commercial purposes. Information may be shared in these limited cases:

- **Open-Source Contributions**: If you contribute via GitHub, your contributions (e.g., code, username) will be publicly visible in our repository under its open-source license.
- **Developers**: The FilmSphere team (Anupam, Rachit, Keshav) may access usage data or profile information internally to debug, improve, or maintain the system.
- **Legal Requirements**: If required by law or to protect FilmSphere’s rights, we may disclose information to authorities, though this is unlikely for an educational project.

---

## 5. Data Storage and Security

- **Storage**: Data (e.g., profiles, booking history) is stored locally on your device via browser storage (e.g., localStorage) or on our servers if hosted (e.g., for profiles). As a learning project, we use basic storage solutions, not enterprise-grade systems.
- **Security**: We implement reasonable measures (e.g., secure coding practices) to protect your data, but as an educational tool, FilmSphere does not guarantee absolute security. Use at your own risk.
- **Retention**: Data persists only as long as needed for the feature (e.g., session duration) or until you delete your profile. Contributions via GitHub remain indefinitely as part of the open-source project.

---

## 6. Your Choices and Rights

- **Profile Management**: You can view or delete your booking history and profile data within FilmSphere’s interface, if implemented.
- **Cookies**: You can disable cookies or clear local storage via your browser settings, though this may affect functionality (e.g., losing your coin balance).
- **Contributions**: You control what you submit to our GitHub repository. Public contributions cannot be retracted once merged, per open-source norms.
- **Opt-Out**: As a free, non-commercial tool, you can stop using FilmSphere at any time to opt out of data collection.

---

## 7. Third-Party Services

- **GitHub**: If you contribute, your data is subject to [GitHub’s Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).
- **No External Analytics**: FilmSphere does not use third-party analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) unless explicitly added later, in which case this policy will be updated.

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy

- FilmSphere is not directed at children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not use FilmSphere without parental consent. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

---

## 9. International Users

- FilmSphere is developed by a team based in **India**. Data is processed where our systems are hosted (e.g., local devices or cloud servers). By using FilmSphere, you consent to data processing in this jurisdiction.

---

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

- We may update this Privacy Policy as FilmSphere evolves (e.g., adding real-time seat availability or user reviews). Changes will be posted here with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use after changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.
